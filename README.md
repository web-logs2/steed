# Steed
<img src="logo.png?raw=true" align="right" alt="" weight="120" height="120"/>Hello, this is a free and complete lisp implementation, most of my Lisp knowledge comes from [Practical Common List](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/) book,
and some old memories. All of these make up my impression on Lisp.
The main reference manual is that book which contains core design and core concepts of Lisp, I will re-design and implement the parts that do not suit my taste.


# Syntax
## Function
### 1. Normal function
The skeleton of a function definition looks like this:
```
(def name (param*)
  body-form*)
```
Where `*` means you can create sequential ones.

### 2. Lambda
When it seems like overkill to define a new function with **def**, you can create an "anonymous" function using a **lambda** expression
```
((lambda ( x y) (+ x y)) 2 3)
```
You can imagine that *Lambda* is name of this anonymous function, it works exactly the same as normal function.

## Variable
You can introduce new variables by **let** special operator. The skeleton of a **let** form looks like this:
```
(let ((x 10) (y 20) z)
  ...)
```
where each variable is a variable initialization form. 
Each initialization form is either a list containing a variable name and an initial value form or as a shorthand for initializing the variable to NIL

## Quote
You can use `(quote ...)` or `â€™(...)` to skip evaluate of s-expressions.

# Progress
It works in progress as I'm read Practical Common List now, you can also contributed your awesome code if you are interested in it.
- `Let*`
- `defvar`
- `defconstant`
