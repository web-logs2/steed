# Steed
Hello, this is a free and complete lisp implementation, most of my Lisp knowledge comes from Practical Common List book,
and some old memories. All of these make up my impression on Lisp.
The main reference manual is that book which contains core design and core concepts of Lisp,
I will re-design and implement the parts that do not suit my taste.

# Syntax
## Function
The skeleton of a function definitio looks like this:
```
(def name (param*)
  body-form*)
```
Where `*` means you can create sequential ones.

# Progress
It works in progress as I'm read Practical Common List now, you can also contributed your awesome code if you are interested in it.
